# [SDF05] CSS Magic Buttons

## Overview

This project focuses on styling buttons using CSS animations and transitions.

## My Design Choices and Experience 
For the buttons in this project, I utilized CSS animations triggered on hover to create dynamic effects:

- **Button 1 (Dance)**: I chose a rainbow linear gradient background inspired by the LGBTQ flag and Pride Month. The animation is named "Dance" to reflect the celebratory and festive atmosphere of Pride events.

- **Button 2 (Jump)**: Implementing a simple jump animation was challenging but rewarding. It enhances user interaction with a playful bounce effect.

- **Button 3 (Shake)**: This button shakes and changes color three times on hover, creating a visually engaging effect. Implementing the multiple color changes within the shake animation was a learning experience in managing CSS animations.

## Learning Goals

I successfully achieved my goals of mastering CSS transitions and animations to create effective and engaging button effects. This project has strengthened my understanding of CSS animation principles and their practical application.
